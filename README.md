# Crabby Rust
This is an experiment to try to get Rust's regex library to work in a TypeScript library. The reason for this is to prevent ReDoS attacks in TypeScript.

It's possible that this project will become that library. It is also possible that this will stay as the test version and a different repo will be made with a different name that will accomplish the goal of a safe TS regex library.
